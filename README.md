### 👨🏻‍🎓 I'm currently in an emotional manipulating relationship with the University of Pretoria where I am finishing my final year as a BSc Computer Science student.
### 👾My ambition in life is to live it to the fullest while being surrounded by good people and vibes.
### 🕺🏻I want to become a Software Developer that works hard and plays harder.
### 🐲I have an alter ego named Déjà Gatsby where I make music and DJ. 
### 🧠One thing that I would stand out from the rest of the Software Developers is my problem solving skills and perseverance to find solutions in the most efficient way possible.
### 🔥In general I am an introverted person but I am an extrovert when it comes to group projects. I don't like to sit back and be quite when developing software
