### Reno Davids says to you "Hello There", how do you reply ?
### a) "Hey there how are you" ? b) "Damn boi what's with that wack profile picture" c) "Ah General Kenobi hahahaha you are a bold one"
### I'm currently in an emotional manipulating relationship with the University of Pretoria where I am finishing my final year as a BSc Computer Science student.
### My ambition in life is to live it to the fullest while being surrounded by good people and vibes.
### I want to become a Software Developer that works hard and plays harder.
### I have an alter ego named D√©j√† Gatsby where I make music and DJ. 
### One thing that I would stand out from the rest of the Software Developers is my problem solving skills and perseverance to find solutions in the most efficient way possible.
### In general I am an introverted person but I am an extrovert when it comes to group projects. I don't like to sit back and be quite when developing software
